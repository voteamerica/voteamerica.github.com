                            <h3>How can I sign up to get or to give a ride?</h3>
                            <p>Simply click the <a href="/#need-ride">I need a ride</a> or <a href="/#offer-ride">I can give a ride</a> button on the landing page and fill in the form. We'll do our best to match you with a driver or a rider. For more, see <a href="/how-it-works/">How it works</a>.</p>

                            <h3>I need to change the details of my signup. How can I do this?</h3>
                            <p>For drivers, the easiest way to change the details of your signup is to pause (NOT cancel) notifications for your current ride offer or request, then sign up again using the same details.</p>
                            <p>This will preserve any matches you've already accepted, while new notifications will have the updated details. I you do not yet have any confirmed matches, you can also cancel your offer.</p>
                            <p>For riders, the easiest way to change details is to cancel your request. If you do not have internet access, you can also call or SMS 804-239-3389, quoting your reference number, and we'll try do this for you.</p>

                            <h3>Where is your service available?</h3>
                            <p>The platform works in any part of the US. Carpool Vote does not provide any additional services apart from matching drivers and riders.</p>
                            <p>We are doing some community outreach in our target states: Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin - which are battleground states affected by various forms of voter suppression.</p>

                            <p>Yes! The platform is available to match drivers and riders at any point during early voting, as well as on election day!</p>
                        </li>

                            <h3>I need voter ID. Will I be able to get a ride to get this?</h3>
                            <p>Yes! Just complete the section on the signup form that lets drivers know where you'd like to go. A driver can then accept the ride request if they are able to drive you to where you need to go.</p>

                            <h3>What is the difference between Carpool Vote and Souls 2 the Polls?</h3>
                            <p>Souls2ThePolls.org acts exactly the same as CarpoolVote.com. Signing up to either site will lead you to the same database. So, a driver who signs up on Souls 2 the Polls could be matched with a rider who signed up on Carpool Vote, and vice versa. The only difference is the words and pictures we use.</p>
                            <p>The new platform was created upon the suggestion of several faith leaders in our target communities. Souls 2 the Polls adopts the language that faith communities prefer to use when talking about offering rides to voters. We hope that this will make it easier for all who use our service to find it and understand intuitively how it works.

                            <h3>I have received a proposed rider match. Does that mean I need to drive them?</h3>
                            <p>A match is only confirmed once a driver has accepted it. If you cannot make the ride for whatever reason, you do not have to do anything. The match will be confirmed for the first driver who accepts it.</p>

                            <p>If you are a driver, cancelling a confirmed match means you will no longer complete the journey. The rider will then have to wait for another driver to accept their request.</p>
                            <p>If you are a rider and you cancel a confirmed match, you will no longer have a confirmed ride. You will have to wait for another driver to accept your ride request. We cannot guarantee that you will find another ride if you have cancelled an accepted match.</p>

                          <p>If the link doesn't work and you can't see a proposed match in the self-service portal, this is good news! It means that someone else has already accepted the ride request and the voter is on their way to the polls!</p>

                            <p>We've found that some drivers and riders are happy to be a little flexible with time or place, once they realize that someone needs or can give a ride. Sometimes, we send drivers notifications for matches that are a little out of their date or time range, just in case they can still make it.</p>
                            <p>If you signed up up to or before November 5, the offers you receive may be a little less sensitive to location and you may receive offers for up to 100 miles from where you are.</p>
                            <p>If this is the case, and you would like to receive notifications for rides a closer to the radius that you signed up for, simply pause (NOT cancel) notifications for your current ride offer, then sign up again using the same details. This will preserve any matches you've already accepted, while making new notifications more location-sensitive.

                            <p> We partner with many organizations that have their own get-out-the-vote driving efforts and would like an effective way to match their volunteer drivers with voters who need a ride at a time and place that works for both parties. Many of our partners ask their drivers to sign up to our platform while continuing to run their own local outreach. Drivers can then accept the ride requests to fill extra seats in their vehicle or dates / times that they still have spare.</p>
                            <p>By working together in this way, we create more ways for drivers and riders to find each other and so improve the chances of voters being matched with drivers. We especially welcome drivers validated and sent to us by partner organizations because we'd like to match them with vulnerable riders.</p>
                            <p>If your organization has access to volunteer drivers and would like to use Carpool Vote to complement your get-out-the-vote driving efforts, please contact partner@carpoolvote.com and we can set you up with our system.</p>

                            <p>Our system is designed to be accessible to all voters – including those who do not use the internet on a regular basis.</p>
                            <p>Many of our partners use the platform to sign up on behalf of voters who have asked them to do so. Each new signup generates a unique reference number, which can be used to access ride request information via our <a href="/self-service/">self-service portal</a></p>
                            <p>If the voter does not have regular internet access, they can elect to receive SMS updates on their ride request status. Once a driver has accepted a match, we will send the driver the contact details for the rider. The rider will then get in touch with the rider.</p>
                            <p>We also have a process in place for partners who expect to sign up large volumes of voters. If this sounds like your organization, please get partner@carpoolvote.com and we can set you up with our system.</p>

                            <p>We can only propose a match a rider match to drivers who are a good fit for the time, location, and seating / accessibility needs of the rider. Drivers can then choose to accept a match if it works for them. We are unable to ensure that drivers and riders will meet each other's criteria.</p>
                            <p>We have done our best to test the system and to ensure that it works the way it's supposed to. Our testing has not revealed any issues that could prevent the system from finding potentially suitable matches - provided user details have been entered correctly. At the same time, we have not had the opportunity to test the system at scale.</p>
                            <p>So, we encourage both drivers and riders to use the platform as one way to complement their other  efforts to give or get a ride.</p>
                            <p>We also encourage local people and organizations to help us promote the project. The more people there are who know about our service in the same area, the more likely it is that a voter will be matched with a driver and so be able to claim their vote!</p>
